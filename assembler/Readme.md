## Assembler
An assembler for RISC-V. 

### How to Use
```assembler.py``` file has everything you need.
```python3
python3 assembler.py --i <assembly_file>  
```
also
```python3
python3 assembler.py --i <assembly_file> --o <out_file.bin>

### TODO
* Only supports few instructions. Add other instructions.
* Supports for x based register naming. Add register mapping which is more dynamic for user.  
* Just list based search. Use a hash table for searching.
