# Documentation of Kythera
Kythera is 32-bit RISC-V based chip. It will contain CPU, GPU, and (maybe) AI accelerator. 
The [core](https://github.com/lilanka/kythera/tree/main/core) module contains all the 
components of the chip. 

Here is all the technical documentation of the system.

# CPU
## ALU
ALU has following operations.
1. Addition.
2. Substraction
3. Bitwise AND
4. Bitwise OR
5. Bitwise XOR
6. 1's complement
7. Decrement
8. And others will be added.
9. Division

So $4$-bit control signal is applied to CPU.
