## KYTHERA SYSTEM 
This is a series of systems that builds a full computer using first principles. Only for educational purpose. Currently developing in my spare time.

```zsh
gates/   - Has some gate implementations (done)
kythera/ - RISC-V processor (single-cycle: done)
KyCC/    - C compiler written in Haskell (working on)
```
