## Kythera
Kythera is 32-bit RISC-V based chip. It contains 5-stage pipelinded CPU core, a sick GPU core, and (maybe) an AI accelerator. The [kythera](https://github.com/lilanka/kythera/tree/main/kythera) directory contains all the components of the chip. The [assembler](https://github.com/lilanka/kythera/tree/main/assembler) is the RISC-V Assembler. There is a 
[bootrom](https://github.com/lilanka/kythera/tree/main/bootrom) too. [Here](https://github.com/lilanka/kythera/blob/main/docs/docs.md) is the technical documentation of the system.
